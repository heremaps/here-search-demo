# HERE Search notebooks

A set of jupyter notebooks demonstrating the use of [HERE Geocoding & Search][4] endpoints `/autosuggest`,  `/discover`, `/browse`, and `/lookup`.

![searching for restaurants](https://github.com/heremaps/here-search-demo/raw/main/docs/screenshot.png)

Requirements: a [HERE API key][1] and a Python environment. Note that HERE Base Plan [Pricing][5] allows you to get started for free.

The notebooks can be [used in your browser][3] without further installation.

## Installation

If you need to install the notebooks or the underlying library on your workstation, run preferably in a virtual environment:

   ```
   pip install 'here-search-demo[lab]'
   ```

Or as a developer:

   ```
   pip install -r <(sort -u requirements/*) -e '.[lab]'
   ```

Link the virtual environment to a IPython kernel:

   ```
   python -m ipykernel install \
     --prefix $(python -c "import sys; print(sys.prefix)") \
     --name search_demo --display-name "search demo"
   ```


Start Jupyter Lab with your HERE API Key:

   ```
   API_KEY="your API key" python -m jupyterlab src/here_search/demo/notebooks
   ```
